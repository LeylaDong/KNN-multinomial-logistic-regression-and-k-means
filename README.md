# KNN-multinomial-logistic-regression-and-k-means

Prepare and explore the data:
1. Make a new column (call it quality_group) that splits the wine into three categories (for low, medium, and high quality). 
2. Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing.

## K-nearest neighbors classification:
Use k-nearest neighbors on the dataset. Because k-nearest neighbors is supervised, use new quality_group column as the outcome for the classification. 

## Multinomial logistic regression classification:
Use multinomial logistic regression to classify the same dataset and use training data to fit the model and testing data to test it. 

## K-means clustering:
Perform k-means clustering on the dataset with k=3.
